### Project Overview

NOTE: This is a PoC that I haven't had time to launch... but maybe one day!

The Contributor project aims to help people:
 - [Learn](../knowledge/) how to analyze malware and malicious network traffic
 - Apply their skills by analyzing [real-world malware](https://github.com/recvfrom/contributor/issues)
 - Write detection content for Snort and ClamAV

### How it Works
1. Project maintainers identify good entry-level malware analysis / network
traffic analysis projects and advertise them in the GitHub
[issue tracker](https://github.com/recvfrom/contributor/issues)

2. Participants pick an interesting project proposal and indicate their
interest in working on it in the issue comments.

3. The maintainers assign the issue to the interested participant(s), and they
begin working on it (using training materials in the
[Knowledge Base](../knowledge/) and with help from the community via the
[Contributor Slack Space](https://contributorproject.slack.com) (Instructions
on joining can be found on the [Getting Started](../start/) page).

4. Participants submit their findings and detection content for review

5. Upon successful review, the detection content is published in the Snort / 
ClamAV community rulesets, and participants add their names to the
[Hall of Fame](../contributions/)

### Current Status
This project is still being launched, but we hope to enter alpha testing soon.
Once we've conducted alpha testing with a handful of individuals contributing
through the project, we plan to advertise the project and solicit more
participants.

### Future Plans
This project would also lend itself nicely to advertising meaningful Snort and
ClamAV software development projects for interested individuals to work on. If
this is something you are interested in, let us know!

### Frequently Asked Questions
#### What is Snort?
The most awesome open-source Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

(TODO answer better, including how many users it has)

#### What is ClamAV?
The most awesome open-source Anti-Virus application

(TODO answer better, including how many users it has, common uses, maybe who uses it)

#### Why was this program created?
From [recvfrom](https://github.com/recvfrom):

By my senior year in college I had developed a good foundation of technical
skills and had a strong desire to contribute to open source projects, but I
didn't know where to start.  Specifically, I didn't know:

 - How I could contribute (what needed to be done)
 - What I'd need to learn to be capable of contributing
 - The workflow for contributing to a given project

Fortunately, a distinguished engineer from Cisco came to my university looking
for students interested in contributing to Wireshark. He did a lot of work with
the IETF and knew of some recently standardized network protocols lacking
Wireshark dissectors.  Also, from contributing to Wireshark in the past he knew
the processes for getting code changes into the project.  He gave us some basic
presentations on the network protocols, the Wireshark dissector API, the coding
standards, and the Wireshark patch submission workflow, and then divided us
into teams to write the dissectors. Through this effort I was able to make my
first contribution to the open source community, something I was very proud of
and which wouldn't have happened without the guidance and mentorship I
received.

This project aims to replicate that with a focus on contributing open source
detection content for Snort and ClamAV.

#### Why should I participate?

 - Snort and ClamAV are well-known open source projects, and listing
contributions to them will look great on your resume. Also, having made
   contributions like this demonstrates that you are
   [smart and gets things done](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/10/25/the-guerrilla-guide-to-interviewing-version-30/)

 - Snort and ClamAV are used by millions of people worldwide, so your
   contributions will have a large impact

 - Many organizations write custom Snort and/or ClamAV detection content
   in-house, so knowing how can be a marketable skill
