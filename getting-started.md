### Account Registration and Setup
 - Sign up for a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join). Project proposals are managed through GitHub, so you'll need an account to participate.
 - Register a [Freenode.net nickname](https://freenode.net/kb/answer/registration). Having a registered nickname will allow you to access the [#snort and #clamav](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=clamav,snort) channels in case you need to ask questions.
 - Register for a [MalShare API Key](https://malshare.com/register.php). This will allow you to download malware referenced in the project proposals.
 - To contribute new Snort rules, you'll need to join the [snort-sigs mailing list](https://lists.snort.org/mailman/listinfo/snort-sigs). Also, consider joining the [snort-users mailing list](https://lists.snort.org/mailman/listinfo/snort-users) if you'd like another avenue for asking Snort-related questions.
 - To contribute new ClamAV signatures, you'll need to join the [community-sigs mailing list](http://lists.clamav.net/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/community-sigs). Also, consider joining the [clamav-users mailing list](http://lists.clamav.net/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/clamav-users) if you'd like another avenue for asking ClamAV-related questions.
