about: Use this template for proposing a new ClamAV signature project
title: ''
labels: 'ClamAV'
assignees: ''

---

**Overview**
Provide 1-2 sentences that summarize what this project involves.  Ex: "Analyze a malicious VBScript used by APT123 and write a ClamAV signature that detects it".

**Proposal**
Provide any relevant background information, high-level details about this project, and any additional information that describe what should be done and why.  If someone else has already reverse engineered this malware and published a write-up, link to that here.

**Technologies Involved**
List the skills and technologies that someone working on this will likely need.
For example:
 - x86 Assembly
 - VBScript
 - Windows APIs
 - .NET Reverse Engineering

**Expected Difficulty**
Estimate how difficult this project will be, and communicate any potential difficulties where possible.  The following are some example difficulty statements:
 - Beginner/Easy - Can be accomplished with basic RE, there is little to no obfuscation involved, there are less than 200 lines of code to analyze, write-ups exist that walk through reversing this malware, etc.
 - Novice/Medium - May require knowledge of complex topics like x86 to RE, some obfuscation must be circumvented, there are 1000 lines of code to analyze, etc.
 - Expert/Difficult - Prior experience with the skills and technologies involved are highly recommended.

**Technical Info**
Post any hashes, useful metadata, and other technical information that would be useful to someone working on this.

IMPORTANT: For making the malware available to download by participants, the
preferred method is to put the samples in a password-protect zip file and
link to it from the ticket.  We DON'T want to attach malware directly to this
ticket.
