**Overview**
Provide 1-2 sentences that summarize what this project involves.  Ex: "Write a Snort rule for the command and control (C2) protocol used by the WannaCry malware".

**Proposal**
Provide any relevant background information, high-level details about this project, and any additional information that describe what should be done and why.  If someone else has already analyzed the network traffic associated with this project and published a write-up, link to that here.

**Expected Difficulty**
Estimate how difficult this project will be, and communicate any potential difficulties where possible.  The following are some example difficulty statements:
 - Beginner/Easy - The C2 protocol is very basic, write-ups exist that detail the purpose of the protocol data, etc.
 - Novice/Medium - The C2 protocol is sufficiently complex to where some thought must be put into how to write a rule to match on the traffic
 - Expert/Difficult - The C2 protocol is complex, and will require additional reverse engineering of malware samples to make further progress.

**Technical Info**
Post any useful metadata, and other technical information that would be useful to someone working on this.
